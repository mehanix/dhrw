# DHRW ~ Visual Data Pipelines
🐝 DHRW is a proof-of-concept for a low-code, IaaS platform to let you visually create data processing pipelines. 

With it, you can:
- **Write** your Python functions (or use functions written by others and imported in the app)
- **Add** them to a GitHub repository
- **Import** them in the app
- **Connect** them to create _execution graphs_, a sequence of functions that data is piped through. 

🚀 With just the press of one button, you can **auto-magically turn a series of functions into a network of Docker containers** that are provisioned with your code and wait to receive and process your data.

You can then **upload** CSV files with your data and **receive** the processing results right in your browser.

Supports both **text** as well as **image** outputs (for plots).

🌐  Pairs really well with GitHub Codespaces to completely **develop right in the browser**.
